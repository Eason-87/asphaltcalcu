### **What Are Asphalt Millings?**

![Asphalt Millings](https://img2.baidu.com/it/u=115483601,682306566&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=JPEG?w=500&h=667)

Asphalt millings are recycled materials derived from old roads and parking lots. When pavement is removed, machines grind it into small, gravel-like pieces that can be reused. Unlike fresh asphalt, millings do not require heating, making them a cost-effective and sustainable option.
**Key Benefits:**  
✔ **More Affordable** – Costs 50-70% less than new asphalt.  
✔ **Durable** – Lasts 8 to 15 years with proper maintenance.  
✔ **Eco-Friendly** – Reuses old pavement rather than sending it to landfills.

### **Where to Use It?**

1. **Driveways** – Ideal for Residential and Rural Properties.
2. **Parking Lots** – Businesses Save Money on Paving.
3. **Gravel Road Repair** – Towns and farms utilize these roads for low-traffic areas.
4. **Construction Sites** – Temporary roads that can be recycled later.

_Note:_ Millings are most effective for light to medium traffic. Heavy trucks may lead to accelerated wear.

### **How to Install?**

1. **Prepare the Base** – Remove weeds, level the ground, and add a gravel layer of 4 to 6 inches.
2. **Spread Millings** – Spread the millings in a layer that is 3 to 4 inches thick.
3. **Compact** – Use a roller or plate compactor to compact the materials and secure them in place.
4. **Optional Seal** –An optional seal—a thin asphalt coating—can extend the lifespan.

**Pro Tip:** For improved stability, combine millings with a small quantity of fresh asphalt or cement.
