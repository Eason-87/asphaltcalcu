### **Key Buying Factors**

Before purchasing crushed asphalt, consider the following factors:
✔ **Grain Size** – Use small (¼”–½”) for driveways and larger (1”–2”) for base layers.  
✔ **Asphalt Content** – A higher asphalt percentage (5–8%) provides better binding but comes at a higher cost.  
✔ **Cleanliness** – Ensure the material is free from debris and excessive dirt.  
✔ **Delivery Options** – Bulk delivery can save money for large projects.

### **Best Uses for Crushed Asphalt**

- **Driveways** – Affordable and durable (lasting over 10 years).
- **Parking Lots** – Effectively accommodates moderate traffic.
- **Road Base** – Road base is utilized by cities beneath new pavement to reduce costs.
- **Farm Roads** – Farm roads resist potholes more effectively than gravel roads.

**Avoid:** Avoid high-traffic highways, as fresh asphalt performs better.

### **Where to Purchase Crushed Asphalt**

1. **Local Asphalt Plants** – Contact nearby facilities for bulk pricing information.
2. **Landscape Supply Yards** – Landscape supply yards may stock smaller quantities of materials.
3. **Online Marketplaces** – Check Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace for local sellers.
4. **Paving Contractors** – Many provide installation and material packages.

**Ask Suppliers:**

- "Do you provide compaction services?"
- "Can I see a sample before placing my order?"

### **How to Assess Quality**

Before purchasing, inspect the following:  
🔹 **Color** – Should be dark gray to black (avoid brown or faded shades).  
🔹 **Texture** – Should feel slightly sticky, indicating good asphalt content.  
🔹 **Debris** – Ensure there are minimal rocks, dirt, or trash mixed in.

**Simple Test:** To conduct a simple test, compact a small pile. If it retains its shape, it is of good quality.

### **Crushed Asphalt vs. Alternative Materials**

| Material            | Cost (per sq. ft.) | Lifespan  | Best For           |

| **Gravel**          | $1.00–$3.00        | 5–8 yrs   | Rural roads        |
| **New Asphalt**     | $2.50–$5.00        | 15–20 yrs | High-traffic areas |
